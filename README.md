# twoBitSynchronousCounter
A two-bit synchronous counter is a digital circuit that counts in binary from 00 to 11 using two flip-flops. It operates in sync with a clock signal, advancing its count on each clock edge. This type of counter is synchronous, meaning that the flip-flops change states simultaneously, ensuring proper timing and avoiding glitches.
